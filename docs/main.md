# Uni IT Security Notes

## Basics

### Security Mindset

- Focus on weaknesses, not on features
- Don't rely on the "good case"
- Anticipate what an attacker could do to a system
- Weight security against user experience and privacy

### Security Objectives

- **Confidentiality**/`conf`
  - Nobody but the legitimate receiver can read a message
  - Third party cannot gain access to communication patterns
- **Integrity**/`int`: The contents of communication can't be changed
- **Authenticity**/`authN`
  - **Entity Authentication**: Communication partners can prove their respective identity to one another
  - **Message Authentication**: It can be verified that a message is authentic (unaltered and sent by the correct entity)
- **Authorization**/`authZ`
  - Service or information is only available to those who have correct access rights
  - Depends on authentication being set up
- **Non-Repudiation**/`nRep`: A sender cannot deny having sent a message or used a service
- **Availability**/`avail`: Service is available with sufficient performance
- **Access Control**/`ac`: Access to services and information is controlled
- **Privacy**/`priv`
  - Restricted access to identity-related data
  - Anonymity
  - Pseudonymity

### Attacks, Threats and Vulnerabilities

- **Attacker**: A person who has the skill and motivation to carry out an attack: The steps needed to carry out an attack
- **Vulnerability**: Some characteristics of the target that can result in a security breach
- **Threat**: Combination of an attacker, an attack vector and a vulnerability
- **Attack**: A threat that has been realized and has caused a security breach

### Threat Identification

- Define **system boundaries**: What is part of your system, what is not?
- Define **security objectives**: What is important for your system to be secure?
- **List all threats** you can think of: Brainstorming and discussion with experts
- Use **conventions**:
  - Similar threat models
  - Requirement specifications
  - How to break or circumvent the specifications
  - Note security assumptions of the system
  - Be careful with perimeter security: What if perimeter has been breached?
  - Note _possible_, but not yet exploitable vulnerabilities

### Network Specific Threat Examples

- Remote Attacks
- Eavesdropping: Sniffing of information
- Altering information
- Spoofing
- DoS
- Session hijacking
- Viruses attacking clients
- Spam
- Phishing
- Data trails/privacy leaks

### STRIDE: Attacks on a Multi-User System

- **S**poofing of Identity
- **T**ampering with Information
- **R**epudiation
- **I**nformation Disclosure
- **D**oS
- **E**scalation of Privileges
